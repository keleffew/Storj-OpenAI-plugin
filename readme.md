# OpenAI Plugin for Storj Decentralized Cloud Storage

## Overview
The goal of this project is to build an OpenAI Plugin that leverages the Storj uplink package to provide functionality for storing and retrieving files on Storj's decentralized cloud storage network. The plugin will allow users to interact with the Storj network using natural language, and it will facilitate operations such as uploading files, downloading files, listing files, and managing access grants.

## Requirements

### User Interaction
- The plugin should allow users to specify the desired action (e.g., upload, download) using natural language.
- The plugin should prompt the user for necessary input parameters (e.g., file path, bucket name) for the specified action.

### Storj Integration
- The plugin should leverage the Storj uplink package to perform the specified actions on the Storj network.
- The plugin should handle access grants for secure interactions with the Storj network.
- The plugin should provide functionality for creating and managing buckets on the Storj network.
- The plugin should provide functionality for uploading and downloading files to/from Storj buckets.
- The plugin should provide functionality for listing files in Storj buckets.

### Error Handling
- The plugin should handle and report errors that may occur during the execution of the desired action.

## Detailed Design

### Access Grants
- The plugin will use access grants as the fundamental unit of access in the Storj network uplink package - storj.io/uplink - Go Packages
- Access grants will be generated using Storj's uplink package and will encapsulate API keys, encryption information, and information about the associated Satellite uplink package - storj.io/uplink - Go Packages.

### Plugin API
- The plugin will expose the following endpoints:
 - `create_bucket:` Create a new bucket in the Storj network.
 - `list_buckets:` List all buckets in the Storj network.
 - `upload_file:` Upload a file to a specified bucket.
 - `download_file:` Download a file from a specified bucket.
 - `list_files:` List all files in a specified bucket.
- Each endpoint will require input parameters specific to the action being performed.

### Plugin Implementation
- The plugin will be implemented using a manifest file that includes a machine-readable description of the plugin's capabilities, how to invoke them, and user-facing documentation ChatGPT plugins.
- The plugin will leverage the Storj uplink package for performing the specified actions uplink package - storj.io/uplink - Go Packages.
- The plugin will handle user authentication and authorization using Storj's access grants.
- The plugin will provide clear error messages for any issues that may arise during execution.

## Example Usage
1. User requests to create a new bucket named "my-bucket":
```
User: Create a new bucket named my-bucket on Storj.
Plugin: Bucket "my-bucket" has been created successfully.
```
2. User requests to upload a file to the created bucket:
```
User: Upload the file image.png to the bucket my-bucket.
Plugin: File "image.png" has been uploaded to the bucket "my-bucket" successfully.
```
3. User requests to list files in the created bucket:
```
User: List files in the bucket my-bucket.
Plugin: Files in the bucket "my-bucket":
         - image.png
```
4. User requests to download a file from the created bucket:
```
User: Download the file image.png from the bucket my-bucket.
Plugin: File "image.png" has been downloaded from the bucket "my-bucket" successfully.
```

## Testing
- Unit tests will be written to verify the correctness of each endpoint and its associated functionality.
- Integration tests will be performed to ensure that the plugin correctly interacts with the Storj network.

## Deployment
- The plugin will be deployed as a third-party plugin on OpenAI's platform.
- The manifest file, OpenAPI specification, and plugin-specific metadata will be provided as part of the deployment process.

## Future Enhancement
- Support for sharing restricted access grants to allow controlled access to specific buckets or files.
- Support for file metadata management and retrieval.
- Support for advanced file operations such as file renaming and moving files between buckets.

## Conclusion
This software specification outlines the design and implementation of an OpenAI Plugin that integrates with the Storj decentralized cloud storage network. The plugin provides a user-friendly interface for performing file storage and retrieval operations on the Storj network using natural language. The Storj uplink package will be used as the primary means of interacting with the Storj network, and the plugin will handle access grants for secure and authorized access to user data.
